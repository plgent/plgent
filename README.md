Hi, I’m @plgent 👋  

I’m a mathematics teacher with a strong interest in LaTeX, piano, and artificial neural networks.  
At the moment, I’m learning more about the `exam` document class, biber, and TikZ/tkz-euclide.

I’m especially interested in collaborating on LaTeX projects for teaching and learning.
